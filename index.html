          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <br> <br>
          <h3>Health Risks and Poverty</h3>
          <h4>The highest corelation can be seen in the obesity and poverty among different health care 
            problems in the states. Overall all the health risks are on inclined curve with poverty.
          </h4>
          <br> <br>
          <h3>Health Risks and Age</h3>
          <h4>If we correlate the obesity and age, people in age between 35-40 are on highest risk of getting obese. Same is 
            the case with somking data. people in age group of 35-40 are more likely to start smoking. One of the reasons can be 
            mis life crisis or incorrect lifestyle choices made from the age of 20 starts showing results in middle age. Same trend is followed for other healthcare issues. 
          </h4>
          <br> <br>
          <h3>Health Risks and Income</h3>
          <h4>In income data, obese percentage is evenly distribited in the graph, which means it does not have any direct corelation.
          But in case of smokes data and income data, we can see, as the income increase somking rates has been 
          decreasing drastically. Which shows person earning well is less likely to smoke.
