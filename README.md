# D3-Challenge

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. 

The current data set includes data on:
# rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state 
MOE stands for "margin of error."


I have created a scatter plot between multiple data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.
Using the D3 techniques I have created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 
I have coded this graphic in the app.js file of this directory, in which data is pulled from data.csv

In the scatter Plot:
* I have included state abbreviations in the circles
* axes and labels are created to the left and bottom of the chart.
* Each axes provides clickable lables to change the datapoints to according to the label.
* Tooltips are added on the circles to make some information avialable to check.
